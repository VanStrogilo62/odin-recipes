    <h2>The Best Beans recipe</h2>
    <p>A rescue recipe for when there's nothing in the fridge</p>
    <p>Or when you fancy something cheap, delicious and filling</p>   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>400g can kidney beans, in water</li>
        <li>1 small pack coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly shredded</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>            
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a low-medium heat. Add the onion and 
            a pinch of salt and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until softened and 
            just starting to colour. </li>
        <li>Add the spices to the pan and cook for another 1 min, by which point everything 
            should smell aromatic. Tip in the chopped tomatoes and kidney beans in their water, 
            then bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 mins until the curry is nice and thick. Season 
            to taste, then serve with the basmati rice and the coriander leaves</li>        
    </ol>
