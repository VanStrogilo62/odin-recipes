    <h2>The Best Risotto</h2>
    <p>Making a beautiful risotto is so easy!</p>
    <p>All it takes is a little love and care and this base recipe</p>   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>        
        <li>1.1 litres organic stock , such as chicken</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>90 g Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>400 g risotto rice</li>            
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the stock. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic, trim and finely chop the celery. 
            Finely grate the Parmesan.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat the oil and 1 small knob of butter over a low heat, add the onions, 
            garlic and celery, and fry gently for about 15 minutes, or until softened but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and turn up the heat – the rice will now begin to lightly fry, so keep 
            stirring it. After 1 minute it will look slightly translucent. Add the vermouth or wine 
            and keep stirring — it will smell fantastic. Any harsh alcohol flavours will evaporate and leave the rice with a tasty essence.</li>
        <li>Once the vermouth or wine has cooked into the rice, add your first ladle of hot stock and a 
            good pinch of sea salt. Turn the heat down to a simmer so the rice doesn’t cook too quickly 
            on the outside.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 knob of butter and the Parmesan, then stir well.</li>
    </ol>
